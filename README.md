# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Belly-Button Overview

In this Module, we used JavaScript, Plotly and D3.js to read and parse the belly button data file, and create dynamic charts that respond to user input. We used all the information we get from the belly button data to build the demographics panel, horizontal bar chart that display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) by the selected individual's ID, bubble chart and finally gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value in measure 0=-10 on the progress bar.
